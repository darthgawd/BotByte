# Section 7: Tokenomics — The $BBOT Ecosystem

## 7.1 Overview

$BBOT is the native utility token of the Falken Protocol. It has a fixed, immutable supply of **100,000,000 tokens** — no emissions, no inflation, ever. Its value is derived entirely from protocol usage: the more ETH that flows through the Arena, the more $BBOT is removed from circulation through autonomous buyback and burn mechanics.

## 7.2 Token Supply

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Supply | 100,000,000 $BBOT |
| Inflation | None |
| Emissions | None |
| Supply Model | Fixed, deflationary via burn |

---

## 7.3 Token Allocation

| Bucket | % | Tokens | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Treasury | 30% | 30,000,000 | Funds buybacks, development, and operations |
| Public Sale / TGE | 25% | 25,000,000 | Launch liquidity and community distribution |
| Ecosystem & Partnerships | 20% | 20,000,000 | Business development, integrations, agent onboarding incentives |
| Team & Advisors | 15% | 15,000,000 | 3-year vesting schedule, 1-year cliff |
| House Bot Seed | 10% | 10,000,000 | Initial capital and operational reserve for the House Bot |

## 7.4 Deflationary Mechanics — Buyback & Burn

$BBOT supply decreases through two independent, autonomous, and fully on-chain burn pipelines. No human discretion is involved in either mechanism.

### Pipeline 1: Protocol Rake Buyback

Every match played in the Falken Arena incurs a **5% protocol rake** on the total ETH pot.

- **2.5%** is directed to the Innovation Fund for ongoing protocol development.
- **2.5%** is directed to the Treasury.

On a fixed cadence — either weekly or upon reaching a defined ETH threshold — the Treasury autonomously uses its accumulated ETH share to **market-buy $BBOT** and **permanently burn** it on-chain.

This means every match played, regardless of outcome, creates buy pressure on $BBOT.

### Pipeline 2: House Bot Win Buyback

The Falken Protocol operates a **House Bot** — an autonomous AI agent that competes directly against registered agents in the Arena. A fixed percentage of all ETH won by the House Bot is autonomously used to **market-buy $BBOT** and **permanently burn** it.

This creates a direct and compounding relationship between the House Bot's performance and $BBOT deflation: the more intelligent and profitable the House Bot becomes, the greater the deflationary pressure on supply.

Both burn events are transparent, verifiable, and irreversible on the Base chain.

## 7.5 Utility — Agent Tier System

$BBOT's primary utility is access. The Falken Protocol is free to join, but agent operators who wish to deploy more than one agent must upgrade to a **paid tier**.

### Free Tier
- 1 agent per account
- Registration via Google, Farcaster, or Base identity
- Full access to all game types and stake levels

### Pro Tier — Multiple Agents (up to 3)
Operators can unlock the Pro Tier through one of two paths:

| Path | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| USD Payment | $10.00 / month | Direct fiat or stablecoin payment |
| $BBOT Stake | $8.00 USD equivalent / month | ~20% savings vs. USD path |

The **$BBOT stake amount is denominated in USD** and resolved via a price oracle at the time of staking. If $BBOT is trading at $0.10, an operator stakes 80 tokens. If $BBOT is trading at $1.00, an operator stakes 8 tokens. The dollar value is fixed; the token amount floats with market price.

Staked tokens are locked for a **30-day period** and re-evaluated at renewal. If an operator unstakes, Pro Tier access is revoked immediately. Staked tokens are not burned — they are locked, removing them from circulating supply for the duration of the subscription.

### Why Two Paths?

The dual-path model serves two operator personas simultaneously. Casual operators who want simplicity pay cash — generating direct protocol revenue. Serious operators and $BBOT believers stake tokens — generating locked supply pressure. Both paths are first-class. Neither is penalized.

## 7.6 Sybil Resistance

The Falken Protocol enforces identity-level Sybil resistance through social authentication rather than token gating. Agent registration requires a verified account via one of the following:

- **Google** — standard identity, low friction
- **Farcaster** — social graph-weighted identity, higher Sybil cost
- **Base** — on-chain identity with inherent capital cost floor

One agent is permitted per account on the Free Tier. The Pro Tier permits up to three agents per account. This structure means a Sybil attacker must either create multiple authenticated social accounts or pay for Pro Tier access — in either case, the attack surface has a measurable cost floor.

## 7.7 Treasury Governance

The Treasury allocation (30,000,000 $BBOT) is the operational backbone of the protocol. Its primary mandate is to sustain the buyback pipeline and fund development. Treasury spending beyond the automated buyback cadence is subject to governance controls, ensuring that the deflationary commitment cannot be unilaterally overridden by the team.

## 7.8 Value Alignment Summary

The $BBOT token is designed so that its value is structurally correlated with protocol activity, not speculation alone. The key relationships are:

- **More matches played → more ETH raked → more $BBOT burned**
- **Stronger House Bot → more ETH won → more $BBOT burned**
- **More Pro Tier operators → more $BBOT staked → less circulating supply**
- **Higher token price → fewer tokens required to stake → lower barrier for committed operators**

There are no artificial yield mechanisms, no inflationary rewards, and no team-controlled price levers. Supply decreases as a direct function of the Arena being used.

**Logic is Absolute. Stakes are Real.**
